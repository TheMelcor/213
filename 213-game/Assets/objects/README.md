Objects are the things you will enounter / see in the enviroment itself. This means rocks, trees, various assets and so on. Remember that the textures related to objects also should be placed in the texture path. There might be change to this in future, but for now use this. There currently are no specifications of ojects, but preferable not too big. Unit size should be in meters and size 1 / 1 (important to remember if you use other modelling programs like 3DS Max / Blender and so on). Also polugon count should be game-ready, that means low as possible but sifficient to see what the object is meant to be. Ideally the polycount for one single object should be within 4 diggits, but in special cases 5 diggits should work. Ideally tho, keep it under 5 diggits (10000). If the object has an animation, set the animation to 100 frames / "ticks", take a look on the treasure chest and animated barrel to see examples of this. Lastly, uv mapped / textured objects is a timesaver to work with at later stages (please?).
