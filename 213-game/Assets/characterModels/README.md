Game characters are an generalization of both human player and the AI. It can be the human controlled character, it can be friendly AI controller players, enemies / foes or general objects that should act as a living thing. Ideally, the characters should support animations. An human controlled character should have an idle state (what does it do when just standing still and doing nothing, breathing and small motoristic movements), an movement staee (jogs / runs, heavy movement with both upper and lower body, more visually affected by the the forces of nature) and an attack state (swings towards certain direction with the upper body and arms to hit something, might coupled with a defensive back-track shortly after). As of timeframe the animations should be short, ideally within 100 frames at 1 / 1 speed (in 3ds max, but it's not that important as we can scale the speed to fit the game on our part). As before, the character sohuld be game-ready and withing the 5 diggits polycount and placed in the gameCharacter folder (within Assets).
