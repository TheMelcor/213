Music! The format should be MP3 in either 128kbps or 256kbps bitrate. Ideally the music transitions should tune in / out or be seamless, and not too distinct starting / ending, but this is open for interprid and mostly up to the author to deside (you cannot argue with the artists they say)!
Also, try giving the audio pieces sensible names, meaning the naming should suggest where the audio piece is suitable. See the current music list for idea how to name the audio files.
