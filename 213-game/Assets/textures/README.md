All textures, regardless if they belong to tiles, objects or characters are to be placed in the texture folder. The texture format is not important, but preferable png due to it's alpha channel support (transparent colors and some other features that the jpg format do not support). Also it is preferable that textures are in size of power of two (like 128 / 128 , 256 / 256, 512 / 512, 1024 / 1024 and so on). It is possible to have various sizes, like 1025 / 256, but keep power of two in mind.
